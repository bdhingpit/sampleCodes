SHORT DESCRIPTION 
-Crude implementation neural network in predicting whether a provided sequence of amino acid will have an alpha helix secondary structure.

GOAL 
-Predict whether a given amino acid sequence will conform to an alpha helix secondary structure.

DATASET
-6129 secondary structure sequences retrieved from PDB then processed. Divided into: 4903 for training and 1226 for test. No validation set was used.

MODEL USED 
-Recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically the long short-term memory (LSTM) variation. For model1, two 128-node hidden layer with sigmoid activation function.

RESULT (for model1)
-Precision (true positive/(true positive + false positive)) = 378/(378+102) = 79%
-Recall (true positive/(true positive + false negative)) = 378/(378+109) = 78%
-Accuracy ((true positive + true negative)/total) = (378+630)/1226 = 82%

*Cut off value for predicted positive is >= 0.51; for negative <= 0.49.
