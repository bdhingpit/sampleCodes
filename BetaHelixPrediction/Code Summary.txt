SHORT DESCRIPTION 
-Crude implementation neural network in predicting whether a provided sequence of amino acid will have an beta sheet secondary structure.

GOAL 
-Predict whether a given amino acid sequence will conform to an beta sheet secondary structure.

DATASET
-6129 secondary structure sequences retrieved from PDB then processed. Divided into: 4903 for training and 1226 for test.

MODEL USED 
-Recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically the long short-term memory (LSTM) variation. Two 128-node hidden layers with sigmoid activation function.

RESULT (test set)
-Accuracy ((true positive + true negative)/total) = 79%
